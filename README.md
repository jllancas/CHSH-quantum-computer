SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS INFORMATION to accompany [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01262](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01262)

Description: The .ipynb files are (Python 3) Jupyter notebooks using Qiskit 1.1

Total No. of Files: There are 6 files, including the README.TXT files

File Names:  README.TXT, CHSH.ipynb, EstimatorExample.ipynb, SamplerExample.m, RealQMCalculations.ipynb, CalibrationData.pdf

File Types:  txt, ipynb, pdf

Instructions: 

(I) This notebook was written using the (free) Anaconda Individual Python Distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/)

(II) The Python notebooks import Qiskit 1.x, which must be installed locally to run the notebooks. 

(III) The file [CHSH.ipynb](CHSH.ipynb) allows the user to perform the calculations related to the CHSH-based Bell test and "triple CHSH" inequality test described in the manuscript using complex-valued and real-valued QM. Qiskit is not used in this notebook.

(IV) The file [EstimatorExample.ipynb](EstimatorExample.ipynb) performs the main experiment using the Estimator Primitive. Qiskit 1.0+ must be installed, and QiskitRuntime is required for running the circuit on actual hardware. An IBM Quantum Account (open-access plan) is also required for using actual quantum hardware.

(V) The file [SamplerExample.ipynb](SamplerExample.ipynb) performs the main experiment using the Sampler Primitive. Qiskit 1.0+ must be installed, and QiskitRuntime is required for running the circuit on actual hardware. An IBM Quantum Account (open-access plan) is also required for using actual quantum hardware.

(VI) The file [RealQMCalculations.ipynb](RealQMCalculations.ipynb) performs the theoretical calculations related to the main experiment for real- and complex-valued QM. Qiskit is not used in this notebook. Two approaches are used for each representation (probability distribution computation and expectation value formulation).

(VII) The file [CalibrationRawScores.pdf](CalibrationRawScores.pdf) contains all calibration information (T1/T2 times and qubit frequencies, gate times, etc.) for all hardware used in this work. The individual scores for all experimental runs are also tabulated with and without readout-error mitigation.
